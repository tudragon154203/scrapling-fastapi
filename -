# FastAPI Project Template

A scalable FastAPI project template with a layered architecture, Docker support, and testing framework.

## Project Overview

This project provides a robust and extensible FastAPI service designed for advanced web scraping. It leverages Scrapling/Camoufox for stealthy browser automation, offering specialized endpoints for various crawling needs, including DPD and AusPost tracking, and TikTok session management and content search. The service is built with a layered architecture, emphasizing modularity, testability, and maintainability, and includes features like proxy rotation, humanized browsing actions, and persistent user data handling to effectively bypass bot detection mechanisms.

## Features

- **FastAPI**: Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Layered Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers for API, core, middleware, schemas, and services.
- **Docker Support**: Containerized application for easy deployment and scalability.
- **Environment Configuration**: Configuration management through environment variables.
- **Testing Framework**: Pytest integration for comprehensive testing.
- **Health Checks**: Built-in health check endpoint for monitoring.
- **Advanced Web Scraping**: Utilizes Scrapling/Camoufox for stealthy browser automation.
- **Specialized Crawlers**: Includes dedicated endpoints for DPD and AusPost tracking.
- **TikTok Integration**: Provides endpoints for TikTok session management and content search.
- **User Data Persistence**: Supports persistent user profiles for maintaining sessions across requests.
- **Humanized Actions**: Implements realistic user behavior (mouse movements, typing delays) to avoid bot detection.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

### Local Development

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-template
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Configure environment variables:
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Using Docker

1. Build and run with Docker Compose:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. The application will be available at `http://localhost:8001`

## Running the Application

For detailed instructions on running the application, see [RUN.md](RUN.md).

## Testing

Run the test suite using python -m pytest:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Or with verbose output:

```bash
python -m pytest -v
```

## Extending the Template

To use this template for your own project:

1. Clone or copy the template
2. Rename the project directory
3. Update `requirements.txt` with your project dependencies
4. Modify the application code in the `app/` directory
5. Update this README with your project-specific information

## Project Layers

### API Layer (`app/api/`)

Contains HTTP endpoints and routing definitions.

### Core Layer (`app/core/`)

Contains configuration and application setup code.

### Middleware Layer (`app/middleware/`)

Contains custom middleware components.

### Schemas Layer (`app/schemas/`)

Contains Pydantic models for data validation.

### Services Layer (`app/services/`)

Contains business logic and service implementations, further organized into:
- **Browser Layer (`app/services/browser/`)**: Handles browser automation and interactive flows.
- **Common Layer (`app/services/common/`)**: Provides shared utilities, interfaces, and base components.
- **Crawler Layer (`app/services/crawler/`)**: Manages web crawling logic, including retry mechanisms, proxy handling, and specific vertical implementations.
- **TikTok Layer (`app/services/tiktok/`)**: Contains services specific to TikTok, such as session management and search functionalities.

## Docker Configuration

The template includes a multi-stage Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for containerized deployment:

- Uses Python 3.10 Bookworm as base image
- Installs dependencies in a separate layer for better caching
- Exposes port 8001
- Includes health check configuration
- Uses environment variables for configuration
