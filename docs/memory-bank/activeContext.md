# Active Context

## Current Sprint: Sprint 19 - Browse Endpoint

### Completed Work
- ✅ Created `POST /browse` endpoint with optional URL parameter
- ✅ Implemented `BrowseCrawler` service with CrawlerEngine integration
- ✅ Added `WaitForUserCloseAction` for manual browser closure handling
- ✅ Implemented exclusive lock for master profile write access
- ✅ Always uses headful mode with user data write mode
- ✅ Added comprehensive API and service-level tests
- ✅ Updated Memory Bank with implementation details
- ✅ All tests pass successfully

### Sprint Goal Achieved
Successfully implemented a dedicated `/browse` endpoint for free browsing sessions to populate the CAMOUFOX_USER_DATA_DIR with persistent user data, without automatic termination or HTML return requirements.

### Next Steps
- Monitor browse endpoint usage and effectiveness
- Consider additional browse-related features if needed
- Plan next sprint implementation

### Technical Notes
- Endpoint mimics `/crawl` behavior with forced headful and user data write mode
- Uses `CAMOUFOX_USER_DATA_DIR` environment variable (default: `data/camoufox_profiles`)
- Writes to master profile directory: `<CAMOUFOX_USER_DATA_DIR>/master`
- Acquires exclusive lock to ensure single writer session
- No HTML content return - purely for user data population
- Reuses existing user data context management from `app/services/crawler/options/user_data.py`
- All existing tests continue to pass

### Recent Architectural Changes
- **Removed `user_data_mode` field**: The `user_data_mode` field has been completely removed from the system architecture
- **Standardized to `read_mode` behavior**: All user data operations now consistently use temporary, disposable user data sessions with timeouts enabled
- **Simplified user data management**: The system exclusively uses temporary clones of the master profile directory, ensuring all sessions respect timeout constraints

### Browse Endpoint Behavior Update
- **Browse endpoint requires write mode behavior**: The `/browse` endpoint should use write mode to allow persistent user data population
- **Write mode characteristics**: Direct access to master directory, exclusive locking, persistent data storage
- **Implementation needed**: The user data context needs to be enhanced to support write mode for browse sessions
- **Current limitation**: Browse endpoint currently uses read mode clones instead of write mode master directory access

### Port Configuration Decision
- **Development run command**: Now uses port 5681
- **Production pm2 command**: Continues to use port 5680

### Test File Refactoring Completed
- **Test directory structure**: Refactored `tests/services/` into smaller, organized directories mirroring `app/services/` structure
- **New test directories**: `browser/`, `common/`, `crawler/`, `proxy/`, `tiktok/`
- **Improved organization**: Tests now follow same pattern as main application services for better maintainability
- **Zero regressions**: All tests continue to pass after refactoring
- **Enhanced discoverability**: Clear separation of concerns makes test files easier to locate and maintain
