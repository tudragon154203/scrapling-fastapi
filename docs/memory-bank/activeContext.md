# Active Context

## Current Sprint: Sprint 22 - TikTok Search Endpoint

### Completed Work
- ✅ TikTok search script debugging and fixes completed
- ✅ SIGI state capture functionality removed for enhanced stability
- ✅ HTML saving process simplified for more reliable operation
- ✅ TikTok search data extraction completed and saved to JSON format
- ✅ HTML post-processing script integration completed
- ✅ TikTok search data extraction workflow fully functional
- ✅ TikTok search endpoint implementation completed with full API integration
- ✅ Request/response schemas created and validated
- ✅ Integration with existing TikTok service infrastructure completed
- ✅ Comprehensive API and service-level tests added and passing

### Sprint Goal
Implement a dedicated `/tiktok/search` endpoint for searching TikTok content using the existing TikTok session infrastructure, with proper data extraction and structured response formatting.

### Next Steps
- ✅ Implement the TikTok search endpoint in the FastAPI application
- ✅ Create request/response schemas for the TikTok search endpoint
- ✅ Integrate with existing TikTok service infrastructure
- ✅ Add comprehensive API and service-level tests
- ✅ Document the new endpoint functionality

### Key Learnings
- TikTok's search functionality requires a logged-in session for reliable results
- BeautifulSoup4 is effective for parsing TikTok's complex HTML structure
- Proper error handling is crucial for dealing with TikTok's dynamic content and rate limiting
- Supporting both single queries and arrays of queries provides flexibility for different use cases
- Deduplication of results by video ID is important when processing multiple queries
- Integration with existing TikTok session infrastructure reduces development time and ensures consistency

### Future Considerations
- Consider implementing caching for search results to reduce load on TikTok's servers
- Explore options for handling TikTok's anti-bot mechanisms more effectively
- Investigate the possibility of adding support for additional search filters
- Consider adding metrics collection for monitoring search endpoint performance

### Technical Notes
- Endpoint will use existing TikTok session management
- Will leverage the debugging and fixes completed in the demo script
- Will implement structured data extraction similar to the demo script
- Will use BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing and data extraction
- Will return structured JSON response with TikTok search results

### Recent Architectural Changes
- **Removed `user_data_mode` field**: The `user_data_mode` field has been completely removed from the system architecture
- **Standardized to `read_mode` behavior**: All user data operations now consistently use temporary, disposable user data sessions with timeouts enabled
- **Simplified user data management**: The system exclusively uses temporary clones of the master profile directory, ensuring all sessions respect timeout constraints

### Browse Endpoint Behavior Update
- **Browse endpoint requires write mode behavior**: The `/browse` endpoint should use write mode to allow persistent user data population
- **Write mode characteristics**: Direct access to master directory, exclusive locking, persistent data storage
- **Implementation needed**: The user data context needs to be enhanced to support write mode for browse sessions
- **Current limitation**: Browse endpoint currently uses read mode clones instead of write mode master directory access

### Port Configuration Decision
- **Development run command**: Now uses port 5681
- **Production pm2 command**: Continues to use port 5680

### Test File Refactoring Completed
- **Test directory structure**: Refactored `tests/services/` into smaller, organized directories mirroring `app/services/` structure
- **New test directories**: `browser/`, `common/`, `crawler/`, `proxy/`, `tiktok/`
- **Improved organization**: Tests now follow same pattern as main application services for better maintainability
- **Zero regressions**: All tests continue to pass after refactoring
- **Enhanced discoverability**: Clear separation of concerns makes test files easier to locate and maintain

### TikTok Search Debugging and Fixes
- **Enhanced robustness**: The `demo/browsing_tiktok_search.py` script has been thoroughly debugged and fixed, resolving critical issues with deterministic waits, SIGI state capture, and Unicode encoding
- **Improved reliability**: Fixed deterministic wait issues, SIGI state capture problems, and Unicode encoding challenges ensure consistent and stable TikTok search operations
- **Enhanced browsing capabilities**: The TikTok search browsing capabilities now feature robust wait mechanisms, proper state management, and full Unicode support for international content
- **Stable data extraction**: Enhanced error handling and timeout management ensure accurate search result retrieval with proper encoding handling

### TikTok Search Script Simplification
- **SIGI state capture removal**: The `_save_sigi_state()` function has been removed from the TikTok browsing script, eliminating complex state-dependent operations that were causing reliability issues
- **Simplified HTML saving**: The `_save_html()` function has been modified to remove waiting mechanisms and delays, streamlining the HTML content saving process to occur immediately after page interactions
- **Enhanced stability**: By reducing complexity and removing timing-based logic, the script now performs more consistently and reliably
- **Direct content capture**: HTML content is now saved without unnecessary delays, ensuring more efficient operation and better user experience

### TikTok Search Data Extraction Completed
- **Task completion**: Successfully extracted TikTok search data from HTML and saved to JSON format in `browsing_tiktok_search.json`
- **Data processing**: Implemented robust HTML parsing logic to extract TikTok search results including video metadata, user information, and engagement metrics
- **JSON export**: Created structured JSON output suitable for further analysis and processing
- **Key insights**: Identified TikTok's HTML structure for data extraction and implemented proper handling of various data types
- **Current focus**: TikTok search data extraction task concluded, ready for next development activities

### HTML Post-processing Script Integration for TikTok Search
- **Task completion**: Successfully integrated HTML post-processing logic into `demo/browsing_tiktok_search.py`
- **HTML processing**: Implemented robust HTML file reading and data extraction using BeautifulSoup4
- **Data transformation**: Comprehensive parsing logic for TikTok search results with proper handling of `likeCount` and other engagement metrics
- **JSON export**: Structured data output to `browsing_tiktok_search.json` for further analysis
- **Key decisions**: Use of BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing, robust error handling for missing data elements, and proper numeric conversion for engagement metrics
- **Current status**: HTML post-processing script integration completed, TikTok search data extraction workflow fully functional

### Decisions and Current Focus
- **API Routes Refactoring**: The API routes in `app/api/routes.py` have been refactored for better organization and maintainability. Routes are now modularized into `health.py`, `crawl.py`, `browse.py`, and `tiktok.py`. The main `app/api/routes.py` now acts as an aggregator, importing and including the modularized routes for each functionality area.
