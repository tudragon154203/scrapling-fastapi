# Active Context

## Current Sprint: Sprint 17 - Humanize AusPost Crawler

### Completed Work
- ✅ Created new `humanize.py` helper module for humanization actions
- ✅ Integrated humanization logic into `auspost.py` crawler service
- ✅ Added new configuration settings for humanization in `config.py`
- ✅ Implemented unit and integration tests for humanization features
- ✅ Enhanced AusPost crawler with human-like behavior patterns
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing API contracts
- ✅ All existing tests continue to pass with new humanization features

### Current Focus
- Sprint 17 completed: Humanization features implemented for AusPost crawler
- Monitoring humanization effectiveness and success rates
- Ensuring consistent human-like behavior across AusPost endpoints

### Next Steps
- Monitor humanization success rates and effectiveness
- Verify integration with existing proxy and retry mechanisms
- Consider additional humanization features for other crawlers
- Plan next sprint implementation

### Technical Notes
- New `humanize.py` module provides human-like action sequences
- Humanization integrated into AusPost crawler for improved stealth
- Configuration settings added for customizable humanization parameters
- Unit tests added for humanize actions in `tests/services/test_humanize_actions.py`
- Integration tests updated to verify humanization in AusPost flows
- Backward compatibility maintained with existing API contracts
- All endpoints benefit from enhanced humanization capabilities
