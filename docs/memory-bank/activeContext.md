# Active Context

## Current Sprint: Sprint 19 - Browse Endpoint

### Completed Work
- ✅ Created `POST /browse` endpoint with optional URL parameter
- ✅ Implemented `BrowseCrawler` service with CrawlerEngine integration
- ✅ Added `WaitForUserCloseAction` for manual browser closure handling
- ✅ Implemented exclusive lock for master profile write access
- ✅ Always uses headful mode with user data write mode
- ✅ Added comprehensive API and service-level tests
- ✅ Updated Memory Bank with implementation details
- ✅ All tests pass successfully

### Sprint Goal Achieved
Successfully implemented a dedicated `/browse` endpoint for free browsing sessions to populate the CAMOUFOX_USER_DATA_DIR with persistent user data, without automatic termination or HTML return requirements.

### Next Steps
- Monitor browse endpoint usage and effectiveness
- Consider additional browse-related features if needed
- Plan next sprint implementation

### Technical Notes
- Endpoint mimics `/crawl` behavior with forced headful and user data write mode
- Uses `CAMOUFOX_USER_DATA_DIR` environment variable (default: `data/camoufox_profiles`)
- Writes to master profile directory: `<CAMOUFOX_USER_DATA_DIR>/master`
- Acquires exclusive lock to ensure single writer session
- No HTML content return - purely for user data population
- Reuses existing user data context management from `app/services/crawler/options/user_data.py`
- All existing tests continue to pass
