# Active Context

## Current Sprint: Sprint 08 - HTML Length Validation and Retry Guard

### Completed Work
- ✅ Implemented DPD tracking endpoint (`/crawl/dpd`) with legacy compatibility
- ✅ Added HTML length validation with configurable minimum threshold
- ✅ Integrated HTML validation into both single and retry executors
- ✅ Enhanced proxy health tracking for short content responses
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for DPD crawling and HTML validation
- ✅ Maintained backward compatibility with existing API contracts
- ✅ Cleaned up duplicate headless parameters in `/crawl` endpoint
- ✅ Removed `headless` field, kept only `x_force_headful` with .env fallback

### Current Focus
- Specialized crawler endpoints (DPD, potentially others)
- Content quality validation and bot detection heuristics
- Robust error handling and retry strategies

### Next Steps
- Monitor DPD tracking success rates
- Consider additional specialized endpoints if needed
- Evaluate performance impact of HTML validation

### Technical Notes
- DPD endpoint reuses generic crawl infrastructure with retry/proxy support
- HTML length validation prevents acceptance of bot-detection placeholder pages
- All new features maintain backward compatibility
- Comprehensive test coverage for new functionality
