## HTML Post-processing Script Integration for TikTok Search
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** 2025-09-11

### Task Goal
Integrate HTML post-processing logic into `demo/browsing_tiktok_search.py` to read HTML from `demo/browsing_tiktok_search.html`, process it, and output structured data to `browsing_tiktok_search.json`.

### Changes Made
1. **HTML Content Reading**
   - Implemented HTML file reading functionality in the TikTok browsing script
   - Added robust file handling with proper error management
   - Ensured reliable access to the HTML source file for processing

2. **Data Extraction and Transformation**
   - Integrated BeautifulSoup4 for HTML parsing and data extraction
   - Implemented comprehensive parsing logic for TikTok search result elements
   - Added handling for `likeCount` parsing with proper numeric conversion
   - Processed various data types including text, numbers, and nested objects
   - Implemented error handling for missing or malformed data elements

3. **JSON Output Generation**
   - Created structured JSON output file `browsing_tiktok_search.json`
   - Organized extracted data in a format suitable for further analysis
   - Ensured proper data serialization and formatting
   - Added comprehensive data validation before JSON export

### Key Features
- **HTML Processing**: Robust extraction of TikTok search data from HTML content using BeautifulSoup4
- **Data Transformation**: Comprehensive parsing logic targeting TikTok's search result structure
- **likeCount Handling**: Proper numeric conversion and validation of engagement metrics
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful handling of missing or malformed data elements
- **JSON Export**: Structured data output in JSON format for easy processing and analysis
- **File Integration**: Seamless integration with existing HTML file generation process

### Files Modified
- `demo/browsing_tiktok_search.py` (updated with HTML post-processing logic)
- `browsing_tiktok_search.json` (generated with extracted TikTok search data)
- `docs/memory-bank/progress.md` (updated)

## Sprint 22 - TikTok Search Endpoint Implementation
**Status:** ✅ Completed
**Date:** 2025-09-11

### Task Goal
Implement a dedicated `/tiktok/search` endpoint for searching TikTok content using the existing TikTok session infrastructure, with proper data extraction and structured response formatting.

### Changes Made
1. **API Endpoint Creation**
   - Added `POST /tiktok/search` endpoint in `app/api/routes.py`
   - Implemented request/response schemas for TikTok search functionality
   - Added proper error handling and validation with HTTP status codes

2. **TikTok Search Service Implementation**
   - Created TikTok search service logic in `app/services/tiktok/service.py`
   - Integrated with existing TikTok service infrastructure
   - Implemented structured data extraction using BeautifulSoup4 in `app/services/tiktok/parser.py`
   - Return structured JSON response with TikTok search results

3. **Schema Creation**
   - Added `TikTokSearchRequest` and `TikTokSearchResponse` models in `app/schemas/tiktok.py`
   - Implemented validation for search parameters including query, numVideos, sortType, and recencyDays
   - Added error response schemas for consistent error handling

4. **HTML Parsing Logic**
   - Created dedicated parser module in `app/services/tiktok/parser.py`
   - Implemented video data extraction from TikTok search results HTML
   - Added support for parsing like counts, captions, author handles, and upload times
   - Implemented robust error handling for missing or malformed data

5. **Multiple Query Support**
   - Added support for both single queries and arrays of queries
   - Implemented deduplication logic by video ID and web view URL
   - Added result aggregation with proper ordering preservation

6. **Error Handling**
   - Implemented proper HTTP status codes for different error scenarios
   - Added error responses for NOT_LOGGED_IN (409), VALIDATION_ERROR (42), RATE_LIMITED (429), and SCRAPE_FAILED (500)
   - Ensured consistent error response format across all error scenarios

7. **Testing**
   - Added comprehensive API tests in `tests/api/test_tiktok_search_endpoint.py`
   - Added service-level tests in `tests/services/tiktok/test_tiktok_search_service.py`
   - Added parser tests in `tests/services/tiktok/test_tiktok_parser.py`
   - Tests cover success/failure paths, validation, and error handling scenarios

### Key Features
- `POST /tiktok/search` endpoint with search query parameter
- Support for both single queries and arrays of queries
- Structured data extraction from TikTok search results
- JSON response with video metadata, user information, and engagement metrics
- Integration with existing TikTok session management
- Reuse of existing CrawlerEngine and user data infrastructure
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes
- Deduplication and aggregation of results from multiple queries
