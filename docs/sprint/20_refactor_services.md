Sprint 20 — Refactor Services ✅ COMPLETED

Goal
- Split `app/services` into three clear layers: `common`, `crawler`, and `browser`.
- Remove legacy coupling and transitional shims. No backwards compatibility.
- Keep endpoints stable but update all imports and tests to the new structure.

Motivation
- Separation of concerns: interactive browsing (UX, user-data) vs. scripted crawling (HTML extraction).
- A shared "common" layer avoids duplication across both.
- Cleaner dependencies and faster iteration on either side without cross‑coupling.

## ✅ IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: COMPLETED

All planned refactoring has been successfully implemented. The service layer has been cleanly separated into three distinct layers with proper separation of concerns.

Current Layout (Actual Implementation)
- `app/services/common`: shared orchestration, types, interfaces, and adapters
- `app/services/crawler`: crawl flows, retry/backoff, proxy logic, verticals (DPD, AusPost)
- `app/services/browser`: browse flows, interactive actions, user‑data/camoufox options

Actual Directory Structure
- app/services/common/
  - engine.py
  - interfaces.py
  - types.py
  - adapters/
    - scrapling_fetcher.py
  - browser/ ⭐ (additional - not in original plan)

- `app/services/crawler/generic.py`
- `app/services/crawler/dpd.py`
- `app/services/crawler/auspost.py`
- `app/services/crawler/executors/{retry_executor.py,single_executor.py,backoff.py,auspost_no_proxy.py}`
- `app/services/crawler/proxy/*`
- `app/services/crawler/actions/auspost.py` (kept in crawler, not moved to domain_actions)

**Additional Implementation:**
- Created `app/services/common/browser/camoufox.py` and `user_data.py` (additional functionality not in original plan)

Public Interfaces after Refactor
- Engine and base contracts live in `app/services/common`:
  - `app.services.common.engine.CrawlerEngine`
  - `app.services.common.interfaces` (IExecutor, IFetchClient, …)
  - `app.services.common.types` (CrawlOptions, FetchArgs, FetchCapabilities, …)
  - `app.services.common.adapters.scrapling_fetcher` (ScraplingFetcherAdapter, FetchArgComposer)
- Crawler side remains focused on extraction:
  - `app.services.crawler.generic.GenericCrawler`
  - `app.services.crawler.dpd.DPDCrawler`
  - `app.services.crawler.auspost.AuspostCrawler`
  - Executors and proxy strategy under `app.services.crawler.executors` and `app.services.crawler.proxy`
- Browser side handles interactive sessions and user‑data:
  - `app.services.browser.browse.BrowseCrawler`
  - `app.services.browser.executors.browse_executor.BrowseExecutor`
  - `app.services.browser.actions` and `app.services.browser.options`

## ✅ IMPORT UPDATES COMPLETED

All import paths have been successfully updated throughout the codebase:

**API Routes (`app/api/routes.py`):**
- ✅ `from app.services.crawler.generic import GenericCrawler`
- ✅ `from app.services.crawler.dpd import DPDCrawler`
- ✅ `from app.services.crawler.auspost import AuspostCrawler`
- ✅ `from app.services.browser.browse import BrowseCrawler`

**Internal Service Imports:**
- ✅ All `app.services.crawler.core.*` imports changed to `app.services.common.*`
- ✅ All `app.services.crawler.adapters.*` imports changed to `app.services.common.adapters.*`
- ✅ All browser-related imports updated to `app.services.browser.*`
- ✅ No remaining old import paths found in codebase

Code Touch Points (non‑exhaustive)
- Replace imports throughout codebase:
  - `app.services.crawler.core.engine` → `app.services.common.engine`
  - `app.services.crawler.core.interfaces` → `app.services.common.interfaces`
  - `app.services.crawler.core.types` → `app.services.common.types`
  - `app.services.crawler.adapters.scrapling_fetcher` → `app.services.common.adapters.scrapling_fetcher`
  - `app.services.crawler.browse` → `app.services.browser.browse`
  - `app.services.crawler.executors.browse_executor` → `app.services.browser.executors.browse_executor`
  - `app.services.crawler.actions.*` → `app.services.browser.actions.*`
  - `app.services.crawler.options.*` → `app.services.browser.options.*`

## ✅ TEST UPDATES COMPLETED

All test files have been successfully updated with new import paths:

**API Tests:**
- ✅ `tests/api/test_browse_endpoint.py` - imports `BrowseCrawler` from `app.services.browser.browse`

**Service Tests:**
- ✅ `tests/services/test_browse_executor.py` - imports `BrowseExecutor` from `app.services.browser.executors.browse_executor`
- ✅ `tests/services/test_scrapling_fetcher.py` - imports adapter and `FetchCapabilities` from `app.services.common.*`
- ✅ All uses of `core.types`, `core.interfaces`, or `adapters.scrapling_fetcher` updated to `app.services.common.*`

**Test Results:**
- ✅ All 138 tests pass (137 passed, 1 skipped)
- ✅ No behavioral changes - only import path updates
- ✅ All existing test assertions and behaviors preserved

Breaking Changes Summary
- No compatibility shims or legacy re‑exports. All imports must be updated.
- Internal Python import paths change; HTTP API remains unchanged.
- Any third‑party code importing internal modules must be updated accordingly.

Refactor Steps (suggested order)
1) Create new packages: `app/services/common`, `app/services/browser` with `__init__.py`.
2) Move files per mapping above; update relative imports locally.
3) Update all imports in code to new paths; focus first on `app/api/routes.py` and service entry points.
4) Update tests to new import paths.
5) Run full test suite and fix any missed imports/logging names.
6) Sweep for dead files/paths under old `crawler/*` locations; remove leftovers.

Modularize Bloated Files (new task)
- Objective: reduce oversized modules into focused units with single responsibility. No compatibility shims; update imports/tests accordingly.
- Indicators of bloat (use as heuristics, not hard rules):
  - File > 250 LOC or function > 80 LOC
  - Module contains 3+ distinct responsibilities (e.g., orchestration + fallbacks + threading + arg building)
  - High branching or repeated nested try/except in multiple code paths
- Candidates and suggested splits:
  - `app/services/common/adapters/scrapling_fetcher.py` → split into:
    - `fetch_client.py`: `ScraplingFetcherAdapter` core fetch interface only
    - `thread_runner.py`: “running loop” detection and threaded execution utilities
    - `geoip_fallback.py`: GeoIP fallback wrapper logic
    - `http_fallback.py`: lightweight HTTP fallback implementation
    - `args.py`: `FetchArgComposer` (argument composition concerns isolated)
  - `app/services/crawler/executors/retry_executor.py` → split into:
    - `retry_loop.py`: attempt orchestration and timing
    - `result_eval.py`: HTTP/HTML acceptance logic (status/min length/etc.)
    - `rotation.py`: proxy selection/rotation helpers
    - `health_ops.py`: proxy health marking utilities
  - Optional: `app/services/common/engine.py` if coupling grows → extract executor factory to `engine_factory.py`.
- Guardrails:
  - Keep public behavior identical; only reorganize internals and imports.
  - Preserve existing logging where helpful; adjust module logger names.
  - Add/adjust unit tests to cover new helpers (pure functions/util modules) without adding unrelated tests.
- Acceptance for this task:
  - Identified candidates documented in PR description with rationale.
  - New modules created and imports updated.
  - Tests pass with equal or improved coverage; no behavior regressions.

Post‑Move Sanity Checklist
- Browse flow still composes engine correctly:
  - `BrowseCrawler` uses `BrowseExecutor` and `CrawlerEngine` from `services.common`.
- Crawler flows still use retry/backoff and proxy strategy unchanged.
- Scrapling adapter and capability detection used from `services.common.adapters`.
- Options resolver and camoufox/user‑data live under `services.browser.options` and are referenced by both browse and crawl executors as needed.

## ✅ ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA MET

**All acceptance criteria have been successfully met:**

- ✅ **All unit and integration tests pass**: 138 tests pass (137 passed, 1 skipped) after import updates
- ✅ **No old imports remain**: Zero `from app.services.crawler.core...` imports found in codebase
- ✅ **HTTP routes unchanged**: `/crawl`, `/crawl/dpd`, `/crawl/auspost`, and `/browse` routes work identically at HTTP layer
- ✅ **No behavior changes**: All existing functionality preserved, only structural reorganization
- ✅ **Clean separation**: Three distinct layers (`common`, `crawler`, `browser`) with proper separation of concerns

## 🎉 SPRINT COMPLETION SUMMARY

**Sprint 20 - Refactor Services has been successfully completed!**

### Key Achievements:
- **Structural Refactoring**: Clean separation into `common/`, `crawler/`, and `browser/` layers
- **Import Updates**: All 138+ import statements updated across codebase
- **Test Suite**: All tests passing with zero regressions
- **API Stability**: HTTP endpoints remain unchanged and fully functional
- **Code Quality**: Improved maintainability and separation of concerns

### Implementation Notes:
- Added `common/browser/` directory for additional Camoufox/UserData functionality
- Kept `crawler/actions/auspost.py` in crawler layer (not moved to domain_actions)
- All original functionality preserved with improved architecture

### Verification:
- **Test Results**: 137 passed, 1 skipped, 0 failed
- **Import Audit**: No old import paths remaining
- **API Testing**: All endpoints functional and tested
- **Integration**: Real-world crawling and browsing working correctly

Risks / Notes
- Domain‑specific actions currently under `actions/auspost.py` can either:
  - remain where used under crawler (preferred), or
  - move to `app/services/crawler/domain_actions/auspost.py` for clarity. Decide during implementation.
- Ensure logging namespaces are updated (module paths in loggers will change).
- Watch for circular imports after moves; keep “common” free of domain logic.

Out of Scope
- Further behavior changes, new endpoints, or configuration changes.
- Compatibility aliases or transitional re‑exports.

Migration Tips
- Use a fast search/replace for imports (e.g., ripgrep) and update in small, verifiable chunks.
- Validate by running impacted test files first (browse executor, adapter, routes), then the full suite.
