# Feature Specification: TikTok Search Strategy Removal

**Feature Branch**: `feat/remove-strategy-arg-tiktok-search`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Remove strategy: Update TikTok search behavior so the API no longer accepts or relies on a strategy field. /tiktok/search should infer the flow from force_headful alone: when force_headful=True, run the browser-based multistep path; otherwise stay headless and run the url param path. Remove any request/response schema references to strategy, adjust services accordingly, and keep all docs, tests aligned with the new contract."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
API consumers can perform TikTok searches without specifying a strategy parameter. The system automatically selects the appropriate search method based on the force_headful parameter, providing a simplified and more intuitive search experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a TikTok search request with force_headful=True, **When** the API is called, **Then** the system should execute the browser-based multistep search path automatically
2. **Given** a TikTok search request with force_headful=False, **When** the API is called, **Then** the system should execute the headless url param search path automatically
3. **Given** a TikTok search request, **When** the request is processed, **Then** no strategy field should be present in the request or response schemas
4. **Given** existing functionality, **When** the API endpoint is updated, **Then** all existing tests should continue to pass with the new simplified parameter set

### Edge Cases
- What happens when users pass an unknown parameter that was previously supported?
- How does the system handle backwards compatibility for clients that may still send the strategy field?
- What error messages should be returned when invalid force_headful values are provided?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The TikTok search endpoint MUST automatically select the appropriate search method based solely on the force_headful parameter value
- **FR-002**: When force_headful=True, the system MUST execute the browser-based multistep search path for comprehensive TikTok content retrieval
- **FR-003**: When force_headful=False, the system MUST execute the headless url param search path for efficient TikTok content retrieval
- **FR-004**: The system MUST remove strategy field references from all request and response schemas
- **FR-005**: The system MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing API consumers who may still send the strategy field [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should this be accepted gracefully or rejected as invalid?]
- **FR-006**: All existing documentation MUST be updated to reflect the simplified API contract
- **FR-007**: All existing tests MUST continue to pass with the new parameter structure
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide clear error messages for invalid force_headful parameter values
- **FR-009**: API consumers MUST be able to search TikTok content without needing to understand different search strategies
- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide search results consistent with the current behavior when using the equivalent settings

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-011**: The system MUST handle strategy field removal without breaking existing integrations [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what constitutes breaking vs. non-breaking change?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TikTok Search Request**: API request containing search parameters, now without strategy field
- **TikTok Search Response**: API response containing search results, now without strategy field reference
- **Force Headful Parameter**: Boolean flag that determines the search execution path
- **API Consumer**: External systems or applications using the TikTok search endpoint
