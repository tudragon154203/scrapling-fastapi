# Feature Specification: One-Shot Import Hoisting

**Feature Branch**: 022-one-shot-import  
**Created**: 2025-09-12  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "# One-Shot Import Hoisting (Python, app/)

Purpose: run a single, carefully scoped pass to move clearly safe nested imports to the top of modules under `app/`. This is a one-off cleanup, not a reusable library, config, or CI policy.

## Scope

- Codebase: `app/**/*.py`
- Exclude: `**/__init__.py`, migrations, generated code
- Output: a single PR/commit with changes and a brief summary

## Goals

- Improve import hygiene by hoisting obvious nested imports
- Preserve behavior and avoid performance or circular-import risks
- Keep the work auditable: dry-run, small diffs, easy rollback

## Non-Goals

- No new library/module, no config files, no pre-commit/CI integration
- No cross-file deduping or public API refactors
- No complicated special-cases beyond a handful of pragmatic skips

## Practical Safety Rules (minimal)

Only hoist when all are true:

- The node is `import` or `from ... import ...` not already at module top level.
- Not inside `try/except`, `finally`, loops, `with`, or any conditional block.
- Not guarded by runtime values (e.g., feature flags, env reads, function args).
- Not a star import; not marked with `# no-hoist` on the same line.
- Not obviously part of a circular pattern (maintain a short manual exclude list if needed).

Skip entirely (do not transform):

- Imports under `if TYPE_CHECKING:` or any type-checking paths.
- Optional imports (patterns using `try: import ... except ImportError:`)
- Platform-gated imports (e.g., `if sys.platform == \"win32\":`)

Rationale: for a one-shot pass, skipping borderline cases is safer and faster than building robust generalized handling."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a codebase maintainer, I want to systematically improve import hygiene by safely moving nested imports to the top of modules, so I can maintain clean and readable Python code.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a Python file with nested import statements not at top level, **When** I run the import hoisting tool, **Then** safe nested imports are moved to the top and grouped by type (stdlib, third-party, local)
2. **Given** I run the tool in dry-run mode, **When** it analyzes the codebase, **Then** it shows me exactly what changes would be made without modifying any files
3. **Given** the tool encounters imports in try/except blocks, **When** it processes the code, **Then** it safely skips these imports without modification
4. **Given** I run the tool on the entire app directory, **When** it completes successfully, **Then** all tests continue to pass and no new issues occur

### Edge Cases
- What happens when nested imports are part of circular import patterns?
- How does system handle files that intentionally have specific import arrangements?
- What happens when imports are conditional based on runtime values?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST identify and locate all Python files in the app directory (excluding __init__.py files and migrations)
- **FR-002**: System MUST detect nested import statements that are not at the top level of modules
- **FR-003**: System MUST skip imports that are inside try/except blocks, loops, conditional statements, or runtime-guarded conditions
- **FR-004**: System MUST skip TYPE_CHECKING imports and optional imports with try/except ImportError patterns
- **FR-005**: System MUST group hoisted imports by category: standard library, third-party, and local/relative imports
- **FR-006**: System MUST alphabetize imports within each category for consistency
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide dry-run mode showing unified diffs of planned changes
- **FR-008**: System MUST be able to apply changes; all tests MUST pass after changes are applied
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve existing comments where possible and avoid disrupting non-import code structure
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle files with no nested imports gracefully without errors

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Python Module**: Individual .py files containing import statements and executable code
- **Import Statement**: Standard Python import or from...import declarations at various nesting levels
- **Import Category**: Classification of imports as stdlib, third-party, or local/relative for grouping purposes
- **Nested Import**: Import statements found inside conditional blocks, functions, class methods, or control structures

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]
