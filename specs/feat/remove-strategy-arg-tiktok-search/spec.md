# Feature Specification: TikTok Search Strategy Removal

**Feature Branch**: `feat/remove-strategy-arg-tiktok-search`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Implemented
**Input**: User description: "Remove strategy: Update TikTok search behavior so the API no longer accepts or relies on a strategy field. /tiktok/search should infer the flow from force_headful alone: when force_headful=True, run the browser-based multistep path; otherwise stay headless and run the url param path. Remove any request/response schema references to strategy, adjust services accordingly, and keep all docs, tests aligned with the new contract."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   -> If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   -> Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   -> Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   -> If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   -> Each requirement must be testable
   -> Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   -> If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   -> If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-23
- Q: How should the system handle backwards compatibility for clients that still send the strategy field? -> A: Reject strategy field explicitly (return error on unknown parameter)
- Q: What should happen to existing integrations that currently rely on the strategy field? -> A: Need reconfiguration (integrations may need updates)
- Q: How strict should the system be about force_headful parameter validation? -> A: Very strict
- Q: Should the system accept partial string matches for force_headful? -> A: Lenient (true/false, TRUE/FALSE, 1/0)
- Q: What error response format should be used for invalid parameters? -> A: Standardized error format matching existing API patterns

## Quick Guidelines
- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
API consumers can perform TikTok searches without specifying a strategy parameter. The system automatically selects the appropriate search method based on the force_headful parameter, providing a simplified and more intuitive search experience.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a TikTok search request with force_headful=True, **When** the API is called, **Then** the system should execute the browser-based multistep search path automatically
2. **Given** a TikTok search request with force_headful=False, **When** the API is called, **Then** the system should execute the headless url param search path automatically
3. **Given** a TikTok search request, **When** the request is processed, **Then** no strategy field should be present in the request or response schemas
4. **Given** existing functionality, **When** the API endpoint is updated, **Then** all existing tests should continue to pass with the new simplified parameter set

### Edge Cases
- Unknown parameters will be rejected with standardized error responses
- Requests containing the strategy field will be rejected immediately
- Invalid force_headful values will trigger clear error messages following existing API patterns

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The TikTok search endpoint MUST automatically select the appropriate search method based solely on the force_headful parameter value
- **FR-002**: When force_headful=True, the system MUST execute the browser-based multistep search path for TikTok content retrieval
- **FR-003**: When force_headful=False, the system MUST execute the headless url param search path for efficient TikTok content retrieval
- **FR-004**: The system MUST remove strategy field references from all request and response schemas
- **FR-005**: The system MUST reject requests containing the strategy field with an explicit error response
- **FR-006**: All existing documentation MUST be updated to reflect the simplified API contract
- **FR-007**: All existing tests MUST continue to pass with the new parameter structure
- **FR-008**: The system MUST provide clear error messages for invalid force_headful parameter values
- **FR-009**: The system MUST use lenient parameter parsing for force_headful (accepting true/false, TRUE/FALSE, 1/0)
- **FR-010**: The system MUST provide search results consistent with the current behavior when using the equivalent settings (â‰¥95% result overlap, <2% variation in relevance ranking)
- **FR-011**: Integrations currently using the strategy field MUST reconfigure to use the simplified force_headful-based approach
- **FR-012**: Error responses MUST use the standardized format matching existing API patterns


### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TikTok Search Request**: API request containing search parameters, now without strategy field
- **TikTok Search Response**: API response containing search results, now without strategy field reference
- **Force Headful Parameter**: Boolean flag that determines the search execution path
- **API Consumer**: External systems or applications using the TikTok search endpoint
