# Feature Specification: TikTok Search Endpoint

**Feature Branch**: tiktok-search-endpoint  
**Created**: 2025-09-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "read and make specs for docs\sprint\22_tiktok_search_endpoint.md"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator or researcher, I want to search TikTok for videos using specific keywords so that I can find relevant content for analysis, inspiration, or content discovery purposes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a valid TikTok session, **When** I search with a single keyword like "funny cats", **Then** I should receive a list of relevant videos with metadata including titles, authors, likes, and timestamps
2. **Given** I have a valid TikTok session, **When** I search with multiple keywords like ["funny", "cats"], **Then** I should receive videos that match at least one of the keywords
3. **Given** I don't have a valid TikTok session, **When** I try to search, **Then** I should receive an unauthorized error
4. **Given** I search with valid parameters, **When** I specify a result limit of 20 videos, **Then** I should receive no more than 20 results in the response

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I search with empty query? → Should return bad request error
- How does system handle when no results are found? → Should return empty results array with totalResults: 0
- How does system handle when server encounters TikTok scraping issues? → Should return internal server error
- What happens when I exceed the maximum number of videos (numVideos > 50)? → Should be capped at 50 or return error [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: not specified]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Users MUST be able to search TikTok content using single or multiple keywords
- **FR-002**: Users MUST provide authentication via valid TikTok session to access search functionality
- **FR-003**: System MUST return search results with video metadata including ID, title, author handle, like count, upload time, and video URL
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to specify the maximum number of results to return (default: 50, max limit: 50)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide result filtering by recency options (ALL, 24H, 7_DAYS, 30_DAYS, 90_DAYS, 180_DAYS)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide sorting of results by relevance (additional sorting options to be implemented)
- **FR-007**: System MUST return total count of available results even when limited by numVideos parameter
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate all input parameters and return appropriate error responses for invalid requests
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle search failures gracefully and return meaningful error messages
- **FR-010**: Users MUST be able to search using either a single string or an array of strings for the query

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Search Query**: Keywords used for searching TikTok content, can be single term or multiple terms in array format
- **TikTok Video**: Content item with unique identifier, title, creator information, engagement metrics, and timestamp
- **Search Result**: Aggregated response containing video matches, total count, and query context
- **TikTok Session**: Authentication token required to access TikTok search functionality [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: session format and validation not specified]
