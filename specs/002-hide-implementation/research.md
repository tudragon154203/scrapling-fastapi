# Research: Refactor Logging for Implementation Detail Hiding

## Current Logging Implementation

**Decision**: The project uses Python's standard `logging` module.
**Rationale**: This is a standard and flexible logging solution in Python.
**Alternatives considered**: None, as the project already uses `logging`.

## Modifying Logging Levels

**Decision**: Change `logger.info` to `logger.debug` for internal/sensitive messages.
**Rationale**: This aligns with the feature requirement to hide implementation details from general users while allowing developers to access them.
**Alternatives considered**:
- Using a custom logging level: Rejected for simplicity and adherence to standard logging practices.
- Filtering messages based on content: Rejected as it's less efficient and more complex than using appropriate logging levels.

## Configuration of Logging Levels

**Decision**: Logging levels will be configured via environment variables, as per the project's constitution.
**Rationale**: This allows for easy adjustment of logging verbosity in different environments (development, production).
**Alternatives considered**: Hardcoding logging levels (rejected due to constitution).
