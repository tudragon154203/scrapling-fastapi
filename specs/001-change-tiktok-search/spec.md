# Feature Specification: Change TikTok Search Headless/Headful Behaviour

**Feature Branch**: `001-change-tiktok-search`  
**Created**: Sunday 21 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "change /tiktok/search headless, headful behaviour: right now the endpoint is headful for normal request and headless for tests. Keep forcing headless for tests, but now the normal requests depend on a new optional payload var: "force_headful": true/false. Only if force_headful is set to True then run in headful mode, otherwise run in headless as well"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user of the TikTok search functionality, I want to control whether the search runs in headless or headful mode so that I can choose the appropriate execution environment for my needs.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a normal search request without the force_headful parameter, **When** the search is executed, **Then** it should run in headless mode
2. **Given** a search request with force_headful set to false, **When** the search is executed, **Then** it should run in headless mode
3. **Given** a search request with force_headful set to true, **When** the search is executed, **Then** it should run in headful mode
4. **Given** any test execution context, **When** the search functionality is used, **Then** it should always run in headless mode regardless of the force_headful parameter

### Edge Cases
- What happens when force_headful is set to an invalid value (e.g., string, null)?
- How does the system handle the case when force_headful is not a boolean value?
- How does the system behave if force_headful parameter is present but missing a value?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST run TikTok searches in headless mode by default for normal requests
- **FR-002**: System MUST accept an optional force_headful parameter in search requests
- **FR-003**: System MUST run TikTok searches in headful mode only when force_headful is explicitly set to true
- **FR-004**: System MUST always run TikTok searches in headless mode during test execution
- **FR-005**: System MUST ignore the force_headful parameter when running tests
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate the force_headful parameter when provided and return an appropriate error for invalid values [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What constitutes an appropriate error response format?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Search Request**: A request to the TikTok search endpoint that may include the optional force_headful parameter
- **Execution Mode**: The mode (headless or headful) in which the TikTok search is executed
- **Test Context**: The context in which the application is running tests, which forces headless mode
