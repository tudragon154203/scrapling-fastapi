# Feature Specification: Refactor Logging for Implementation Detail Hiding

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-don-t`  
**Created**: Monday 22 September 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I don't want to leak out implementation details or crawling methods onto logger.info. Change all logger.info that reveals internal process into logger.debug, so that only me or other dev can turn on log level DEBUG and see the details. All users only see non-important logger.info ones without knowing the implementation"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to ensure that sensitive implementation details and crawling methods are not exposed in `logger.info` messages to end-users, so that only authorized personnel (developers) can view these details by enabling `DEBUG` level logging.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the application is running, **When** an internal process or crawling method logs information using `logger.debug`, **Then** this information is only visible when the logging level is set to `DEBUG` or lower.
2. **Given** the application is running, **When** a non-sensitive, user-facing event is logged using `logger.info`, **Then** this information is visible to all users regardless of the logging level (unless explicitly filtered).
3. **Given** the application is running with default logging settings (typically `INFO`), **When** an internal process or crawling method executes, **Then** no implementation details or crawling methods are visible in the logs.

### Edge Cases
- What happens if a `logger.info` message accidentally contains sensitive information after the refactoring? (This should be caught during review/testing).
- How does the system handle existing `logger.info` calls that are genuinely intended for general user information? (These should remain as `logger.info`).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The system MUST differentiate between internal process/crawling method logs and general user-facing information logs.
- **FR-002**: All log messages containing implementation details or crawling methods MUST be changed from `logger.info` to `logger.debug`.
- **FR-003**: Log messages intended for general user information MUST remain at `logger.info` level.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST allow developers to view `logger.debug` messages by configuring the logging level.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST NOT expose `logger.debug` messages to end-users under normal operating conditions (i.e., when the logging level is not explicitly set to `DEBUG` or lower).
